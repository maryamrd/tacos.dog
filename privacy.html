				<p class = "h3-pink">Overview</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">Tacos.dog (the "Site"), collectively "we" or "us", are committed to protecting your privacy on the Internet. This privacy policy tells you about the types of information that may be collected from you while you use the site, how that information will be used, who can see it and your rights to review and request changes to it.</p>
				<p class = "h3-pink">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">When you access the Site, certain information such as your navigation through the Site, browser used and time spent, along with other similar information, may be stored on our servers and on third party servers. This information is never connected with any personal information and is treated confidentially. It is collected only to help us understand the preferences of our visitors and improve their experiences on the Site.</p>
				<p class = "h3-pink">Use of Cookies</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">We may occasionally use cookies, pieces of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user, to identify your computer on future visits to the site. This allows us to save your preferences and avoid asking you the same questions we asked on your previous visits and will never be linked to any information that would allow you to be personally identified. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although, if you do, you may not be able to use certain features on the site and may be required to re-enter information more frequently to use certain services on the Site. We mostly use cookies to track the number of tacos you 'donate.' Therefore, if cookies are disabled, your tacos cannot be counted in our totals and will not be converted into a dollar figure for our charity donations.</p>
				<p class = "h3-pink">Personally Identifiable Information</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">Tacos.dog is accessible to everyone. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about our users through the Site.</p>
				<p class = "h3-pink">Access to Collected Information</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">We take reasonable steps to protect all of your information, but we assume no responsibility for the security of the information you submit on the Site. We do not sell or share any of your information with any third parties.</p>
				<p class = "h3-pink">Links to Other Sites</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">If you click on ads or links to third party sites, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third party sites. Our site may also serve third party content that contains their own cookies or tracking technologies. We do not control the use of those technologies.</p>
				<p class = "h3-pink">Privacy Policy Changes</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">This policy is effective as of 11/11/2018. Changes to this privacy policy will be posted here. We will not be actively contacting you with updates, so please check back frequently for any changes.</p>
