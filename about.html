				<p class = "p-purple">It only takes an estimated $1 a day to provide for an animal in a shelter. Inspired by games like <a href = "https://www.beanbeanbean.com">BeanBeanBean</a> and Freerice, we wanted to apply that game logic to something that would contribute to our passion, saving animals in shelters.</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">100% of our ad revenue goes in a 50/50 split to the Best Friends Animal Society and LA Animal Services â€“ both great hands-on organizations. The more you play, the more dogs you help save! Thanks to ad networks every user who plays or clicks on ads funds the site and helps us save dogs and cats in shelters.</p>
				<p class = "p-purple">PS: We truly believe in voting with your wallet, so we would like to provide <a href = "https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/list-of-cruelty-free-brands/" target = "_blank">this list of resources</a> for you to further explore how to help animals on a wider scale.</p>
